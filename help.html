		<h1>How to Play</h1>

		<p>To play the game, you are given 10 items to be placed in their respective zones. Simply use your mouse to drag an item and drop it into one of the 3 Zones.</p>
		<p>The 3 Zones are described as the following:</p>
		<ol style="text-align: left;">
			<li>
				The <a href="resources.html?iframe=true&width=55%&height=80%"  class="link1" rel="prettyphoto[iframes]">Safety Zone</a> (Green), which contains hundreds of thousands of books, millions of scholarly articles, hundreds of hours of video, and other resources Marist has already obtained copyright permission for you to use.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <a href="msz.html?iframe=true&width=55%&height=80%"  class="link1" rel="prettyphoto[iframes]">Moderately Safe Zone</a> (Yellow) has far fewer resources. For the most part copyright permission has not been obtained by the College and in some cases would require you to obtain permission before they can be used in your class.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <a href="danger.html?iframe=true&width=55%&height=80%"  class="link1" rel="prettyphoto[iframes]">Danger Zone</a> (Red). Resources in this zone definitely require you to obtain permission and pay fees for limited use.
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>If you are still having difficulties with the game, click <a href="http://library.marist.edu/forms/ask.php" target="_blank">Ask a Librarian</a> to assist you.</p>
		
		<p style="font-size:11px;"><em>Otherwise, you can pull on the red ribbon and see what happens.</em></p>
