				<h3> Marist Copyright Policy </h3>
				<div class="accordioninfo">
					<p>
						It is the policy of Marist College to comply with all existing United States copyright laws including the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976, the TEACH Act of 2002, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.   All college faculty, staff and students are expected to act both responsibly and ethically when using copyrighted works (such as print and electronic documents, web-based content, visual materials, photographs, music and other forms of creative works) which includes making informed decisions based on the “fair use” exemptions to these laws.
					</p>
					<p>
						The College strongly recommends that members of the Marist community limit their use of copyright protected materials to the hundreds of thousands of resources available through the James A. Cannavino Library (for which the college already holds the necessary licenses) or the millions of works available for educational use under Creative Commons licenses.  If copyright protected materials which are not available through these sources are vital to your work, you may request assistance, through the Library, in seeking the acquisition of, or permission to use these materials.  Such requests may take several weeks or months to complete and may include related service fees. It is also possible the desired work is simply unavailable.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are unable to find appropriate materials that are already licensed for your use and do not have time to seek permission to use the materials, you can, at your own risk, consider using it under the “fair use” exemption.  Decisions to use materials under the “fair use” exemption should be made on a case-by-case basis, re-evaluated each time the materials are used and be documented in writing as means to record the rationale for “fair use”.  The College does not assume legal or financial responsibility for any independent application of copyright principles made by College faculty or staff that do not meet the terms of related copyright law or this policy.
					</p>
